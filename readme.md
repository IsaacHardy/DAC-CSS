**STEPS** to take before you start contributing:


Step 1: Read The Rules - (Commandments)
---

Command | Description
---|---
Thou Shalt Create Quality Posts | Quality posts should have a 'topic of debate' in which you state your stance/argument inside the OP. Remember to demonstrate your point thoroughly and precisely. Posts that are deemed to be of low quality/low-effort **(As defined in Commandment #2)**, or do not have a 'topic of debate' with your stance in the OP, will be removed.
Thou Shalt Create Quality Comments | When replying to a post or another comment, make sure it is of high quality. High quality constitutes as anything consisting of substantial, informative, well reasoned, properly cited (if relevant), respectful, and well written content. There is no set length to quality comments, but remember to demonstrate your point thoroughly and precisely. Comments that do not attempt debate and/or do not demonstrate high quality practices, are subject to removal.
Thou Shalt Not Insult or Antagonize Other Redditors | We take serious action against those who break this commandment. Any comment or post that directly insults/antagonizes another user will be removed and the perpetrator warned/banned. This includes statements that identify as an 'ad hominem'. 
Thou Shalt Honor Thy Pilate Program | Occasionally participants may want to narrow the answer pool to only a specific set of users.  A person could specify [Catholic] and ONLY Catholics should reply as a top level comment to the post. All may join the discussion by replying to top posts of the "Pilates", but only the specified group can be the top comment in a comment family. All other top level replies will be removed.
Thou Shalt Ask to Create Meta Posts | A Meta post created without the permission of the mod-team will automatically be removed. Meta posts are allowed, but permission must be granted first.
Thou Shalt Choose Honest/Accurate Flair. | The purpose of flair is to allow more efficient communication in debates. Choosing the wrong flair or flair that is seen as breaking subsequent rules fails to accomplish this goal.
Thou Shalt Request Custom Flair Within Specific Parameters | If you do not see the flair you would like to have listed in the stock flair options, you can request custom flair by messaging the mods, and it will be assigned to you. The following are the criteria for custom flair requests: Limited to two classifications e.g. [Baptist, Ex-Catholic], Must be relevant to religious discussion i.e. signify religious/spiritual belief or lack thereof, and No parody religions.
Thou Shalt Follow **[Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)**. | Thou Shalt Also Click The Reddiquette Link
Thou Shalt Use Thy Report Button | If someone breaks one of these commandments, use the report button! Do not reply!
Thou Shalt Honor The Spirit of These Commandments | Remember the golden rule: 'Treat others as you would have them treat you!' 

Step 2: Why you might not see your posts/comments
---
* If you believe your posts aren't visible, then **Automod** might be to blame! Automod will remove comments/posts from you if:


Your account age is less than 7 days old

Your karma is less than (+)10

Your post is less than 100 characters

--- 

* **NOTE: Mods will only approve posts removed by Automod if requested by the user who's messages are being removed. Even if requested, approval of removed posts are still up to mod discretion.**
